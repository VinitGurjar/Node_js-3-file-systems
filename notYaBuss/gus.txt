$How ‘Cyberpunk: Edgerunners’ Expands on CDPR’s Night City Lore.

 >There have always been children wandering the streets of Night City, their squished down
  adult model bodies haunting alleyways and sidewalks. Even so we knew very little about 
  their day to day lives, save free time consisting of hopscotch and, if you have a handsome
  ex-detective uncle, some copaganda VR. The introduction of Arasaka Academy in Cyberpunk: 
  Edgerunners opened up a new world of potential truancy bounties with the confirmation that 
  education does in fact still exist. (Let V put those kids in jail for seven whole eddies!)
